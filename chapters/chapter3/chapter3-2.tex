\begin{exercise}
  \enum{
  \item Where in the proof of Theorem 3.2.3 part (ii) does the assumption that the collection of open sets be finite get used?
  \item Give an example of a countable collection of open sets $\left\{O_{1}, O_{2}, O_{3}, \ldots\right\}$ whose intersection $\bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty} O_{n}$ is closed, not empty and not all of $\mathbf{R}$.
  }
\end{exercise}

\begin{solution}
  \enum{
  \item Taking $\min\{\epsilon_1, \dots, \epsilon_N\}$ is only possible for finite sets.
  \item $O_n = (-1/n, 1 + 1/n)$ has $\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty O_n = [0, 1]$.
  }
\end{solution}

\begin{exercise}
  Let
  $$A=\left\{(-1)^{n}+\frac{2}{n}: n=1,2,3, \ldots\right\} \quad \text { and } \quad B=\{x \in \mathbf{Q}: 0<x<1\}$$
  Answer the following questions for each set:
  \enum{
  \item What are the limit points?
  \item Is the set open? Closed?
  \item Does the set contain any isolated points?
  \item Find the closure of the set.
  }
\end{exercise}

\begin{solution}
  \enum{
  \item The set of $B$'s limit points is $[0, 1]$. The set of $A$'s limit points is $\{1, -1\}$.
  \item
    $B$ is not open since every $(a,b) \not\subseteq B$ and $B$ is not closed since we can construct limits to irrational values outside $B$.
    $A$ is closed since $\{1, -1\} \subseteq A$, but not open as it does not contain any irrationals meaning $(a,b) \not\subseteq A$ for all $a,b \in \mathbf{R}$.
  \item
    Every point of $A$ except the limit points $\{1, -1\}$ is isolated, as if it were not isolated it would be a limit point.
    $B$ has no isolated points since $B \setminus [0, 1] = \emptyset$, or in other words since $B$ is dense in $[0,1]$ every $b \in B \subseteq [0,1]$ can be reached via a limit.
  \item $\closure A = A$ as $A$ is already closed, and $\closure B = B \cup [0,1] = [0,1]$.
  }
\end{solution}

\begin{exercise}
  Decide whether the following sets are open, closed, or neither. If a set is not open, find a point in the set for which there is no $\epsilon$-neighborhood contained in the set. If a set is not closed, find a limit point that is not contained in the set.
  \enum{
  \item $\mathbf{Q}$.
  \item $\mathbf{N}$.
  \item $\{x \in \mathbf{R}: x \neq 0\}$.
  \item $\left\{1+1 / 4+1 / 9+\cdots+1 / n^{2}: n \in \mathbf{N}\right\}$
  \item $\{1+1 / 2+1 / 3+\cdots+1 / n: n \in \mathbf{N}\}$

\begin{exercise}[De Morgan's Laws]
  A proof for De Morgan's Laws in the case of two sets is outlined in Exercise 1.2.5. The general argument is similar.

    $$
    \left(\bigcup_{\lambda \in \Lambda} E_{\lambda}\right)^{c}=\bigcap_{\lambda \in \Lambda} E_{\lambda}^{c} \quad \text { and } \quad\left(\bigcap_{\lambda \in \Lambda} E_{\lambda}\right)^{c}=\bigcup_{\lambda \in \Lambda} E_{\lambda}^{c}

\begin{exercise}
  A dual notion to the closure of a set is the \emph{interior} of a set. The interior of $E$ is denoted $E^{\circ}$ and is defined as
  $$
  E^{\circ}=\left\{x \in E: \text { there exists } V_{\epsilon}(x) \subseteq E\right\}
  $$
  Results about closures and interiors possess a useful symmetry.
  \enum{
  \item Show that $E$ is closed if and only if $\bar{E}=E .$ Show that $E$ is open if and only if $E^{\circ}=E$.
  \item Show that $\bar{E}^{c}=\left(E^{c}\right)^{\circ}$, and similarly that $\left(E^{\circ}\right)^{c}=\overline{E^{c}}$.

  A set $A$ is called an $F_{\sigma}$ set if it can be written as the countable union of closed sets. A set $B$ is called a $G_{\delta}$ set if it can be written as the countable intersection of open sets.
  \enum{
  \item Show that a closed interval $[a, b]$ is a $G_{\delta}$ set.
  \item Show that the half-open interval $(a, b]$ is both a $G_{\delta}$ and an $F_{\sigma}$ set.
  \item Show that $\mathbf{Q}$ is an $F_{\sigma}$ set, and the set of irrationals $\mathbf{I}$ forms a $G_{\delta}$ set. (We will see in Section $3.5$ that $\mathbf{Q}$ is not a $G_{\delta}$ set, nor is $\mathbf{I}$ an $F_{\sigma}$ set.)
