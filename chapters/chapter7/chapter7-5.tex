\begin{exercise}
\enum{
\item Let $f(x)=|x|$ and define $F(x)=\int_{-1}^{x} f$. Find a piecewise algebraic formula for $F(x)$ for all $x$. Where is $F$ continuous? Where is $F$ differentiable? Where does $F^{\prime}(x)=f(x)$ ?
\item Repeat part (a) for the function

\begin{exercise}
Decide whether each statement is true or false, providing a short justification for each conclusion.
\enum{
\item If $g=h^{\prime}$ for some $h$ on $[a, b]$, then $g$ is continuous on $[a, b]$.
\item If $g$ is continuous on $[a, b]$, then $g=h^{\prime}$ for some $h$ on $[a, b]$.
\item If $H(x)=\int_{a}^{x} h$ is differentiable at $c \in[a, b]$, then $h$ is continuous at $c$.
}
\end{exercise}
\begin{solution}
\enum{
\item False, e.g. \(h(x) = x^2 \sin (1/x)\) as explored in section 5.1.
\item True; if \(g\) is continuous then it is also integrable, and by the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus we have that \(G(x) = \int^x_a g\) is differentiable over \([a,b]\) with \(G' = g\).
\item False; consider Thomae's function \(t(x)\). From Exercise 7.3.2 we have that \(t\) is integrable with \(\int^1_0 t = 0\); it's also easy to show that \(\int^x_0 t = 0\). Then \(H(x) = 0\) is differentiable over \([0,1]\), but \(t(x)\) is not continuous over \([0,1]\).
}
\end{solution}

\begin{exercise} The hypothesis in Theorem 7.5.1 (i) that $F^{\prime}(x)=f(x)$ for all $x \in[a, b]$ is slightly stronger than it needs to be. Carefully read the proof and state exactly what needs to be assumed with regard to the relationship between $f$ and $F$ for the proof to be valid.
\end{exercise}
\begin{solution}
We use the Mean Value Theorem to ensure that for all subintervals of a particular partition \([x_{k-1}, x_k]\), we have \(F(x_k) - F(x_{k-1}) = F'(t_k) (x_k - x_{k-1})\). But the MVT does not require that \(F\) is differentiable at the endpoints, so we can relax the requirement slightly and have \(F'(x) = f(x)\) over the open interval \((a,b)\).
\end{solution}

\begin{exercise} Show that if $f:[a, b] \rightarrow \mathbf{R}$ is continuous and $\int_{a}^{x} f=0$ for all $x \in[a, b]$, then $f(x)=0$ everywhere on $[a, b]$. Provide an example to show that this conclusion does not follow if $f$ is not continuous. Exercise 7.5.5. The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus can be used to supply a shorter argument for Theorem 6.3.1 under the additional assumption that the sequence of derivatives is continuous.
Assume $f_{n} \rightarrow f$ pointwise and $f_{n}^{\prime} \rightarrow g$ uniformly on $[a, b]$. Assuming each $f_{n}^{\prime}$ is continuous, we can apply Theorem 7.5.1 (i) to get
$$
\int_{a}^{x} f_{n}^{\prime}=f_{n}(x)-f_{n}(a)
$$
for all $x \in[a, b]$. Show that $g(x)=f^{\prime}(x)$.

\begin{exercise}[Integration-by-parts]
\enum{
\item Assume $h(x)$ and $k(x)$ have continuous derivatives on $[a, b]$ and derive the familiar integration-by-parts formula
$$
\int_{a}^{b} h(t) k^{\prime}(t) d t=h(b) k(b)-h(a) k(a)-\int_{a}^{b} h^{\prime}(t) k(t) d t

\begin{exercise} Use part (ii) of Theorem 7.5.1 to construct another proof of part (i) of Theorem 7.5.1 under the stronger hypothesis that $f$ is continuous. (To get started, set \(G(x)=\int_{a}^{x} f\).)

\begin{exercise}[Natural Logarithm and Euler's Constant]
    Let
$$
L(x)=\int_{1}^{x} \frac{1}{t} d t
$$
where we consider only $x>0$.
\enum{
\item What is $L(1)$ ? Explain why $L$ is differentiable and find $L^{\prime}(x)$.
\item Show that $L(x y)=L(x)+L(y)$. (Think of $y$ as a constant and differentiate $g(x)=L(x y)$)
\item Show $L(x / y)=L(x)-L(y)$.
\item Let
$$
\gamma_{n}=\left(1+\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}+\cdots+\frac{1}{n}\right)-L(n) \text {. }
$$
Prove that $\left(\gamma_{n}\right)$ converges. The constant $\gamma=\lim \gamma_{n}$ is called Euler's constant.
\item Show how consideration of the sequence $\gamma_{2 n}-\gamma_{n}$ leads to the interesting identity
$$
L(2)=1-\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}-\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{5}-\frac{1}{6}+\cdots .

\begin{exercise}
Given a function $f$ on $[a, b]$, define the total variation of $f$ to be
$$
V f=\sup \left\{\sum_{k=1}^{n}\left|f\left(x_{k}\right)-f\left(x_{k-1}\right)\right|\right\},
$$
where the supremum is taken over all partitions $P$ of $[a, b]$.
\enum{
\item If $f$ is continuously differentiable ( $f^{\prime}$ exists as a continuous function), use the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to show $V f \leq \int_{a}^{b}\left|f^{\prime}\right|$.
\item Use the Mean Value Theorem to establish the reverse inequality and conclude that $V f=\int_{a}^{b}\left|f^{\prime}\right|$.

\begin{exercise}[Change-of-variable Formula] Let $g:[a, b] \rightarrow \mathbf{R}$ be differentiable and assume $g^{\prime}$ is continuous. Let $f:[c, d] \rightarrow \mathbf{R}$ be continuous, and assume that the range of $g$ is contained in $[c, d]$ so that the composition $f \circ g$ is properly defined.
\enum{
\item Why are we sure $f$ is the derivative of some function? How about $(f \circ g) g^{\prime}$ ?
\item Prove the change-of-variable formula
$$
\int_{a}^{b} f(g(x)) g^{\prime}(x) d x=\int_{g(a)}^{g(b)} f(t) d t .

\begin{exercise} Assume $f$ is integrable on $[a, b]$ and has a "jump discontinuity" at $c \in(a, b)$. This means that both one-sided limits exist as $x$ approaches $c$ from the left and from the right, but that
$$
\lim _{x \rightarrow c^{-}} f(x) \neq \lim _{x \rightarrow c^{+}} f(x) .
$$
(This phenomenon is discussed in more detail in Section 4.6.)
\enum{
\item Show that, in this case, $F(x)=\int_{a}^{x} f$ is not differentiable at $x=c$.
\item The discussion in Section $5.5$ mentions the existence of a continuous monotone function that fails to be differentiable on a dense subset of $\mathbf{R}$. Combine the results of part (a) with Exercise 6.4.10 to show how to construct such a function.
