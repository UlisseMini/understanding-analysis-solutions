\section{The Weierstrauss Approximation Theorem}

\begin{exercise}
Assuming WAT, show that if \(f\) is continuous on \([a, b]\), then there exists a sequence \((p_n)\) of polynomials such that \(p_n \to f\) uniformly on \([a, b]\).
\end{exercise}
\begin{solution}
Repeatedly apply WAT with \(\epsilon = 1/n\).
\end{solution}
