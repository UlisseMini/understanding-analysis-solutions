\section{The Cauchy Criterion}

\begin{exercise}
  Proving the Alternating Series Test (Theorem 2.7.7) amounts to showing that the sequence of partial sums
  $$
  s_{n}=a_{1}-a_{2}+a_{3}-\cdots \pm a_{n}
  $$
  converges. (The opening example in Section $2.1$ includes a typical illustration of $\left(s_{n}\right)$.) Different characterizations of completeness lead to different proofs.

  \enum{
  \item Prove the Alternating Series Test by showing that $\left(s_{n}\right)$ is a Cauchy sequence.
  \item Supply another proof for this result using the Nested Interval Property (Theorem 1.4.1).
  \item Consider the subsequences $\left(s_{2 n}\right)$ and $\left(s_{2 n+1}\right)$, and show how the Monotone Convergence Theorem leads to a third proof for the Alternating Series Test.
  }
\end{exercise}

\begin{solution}
  The fundemental reason the alternating series test works is that the partial sums stay inside intervals which are getting smaller. Always keep the fundemental reason in mind when proving things.
  \enum{
  \item We would like to show $|a_{m+1} - a_{m+2} + \dots \pm a_{n}|$ becomes arbitrarily small. \TODO
  \item Let $I_1$ be the interval $[a_1 - a_2, a_1]$ and in general $I_n = [a_n - a_{n+1}, a_n]$ we have $I_{n+1} \subseteq I_n$ since $(a_n)$ is decreasing. The nested interval property gives
    $$\bigcap_{n=1}^\infty I_n \ne \emptyset$$
    Let $x \in \bigcap_{n=1}^\infty I_n$, since $a_n \in I_n$ and $x \in I_n$ the distance $|a_n - x|$ must be less then the length $|I_n|$. and since the length goes to zero $|a_n - x|$ can be made less then any $\epsilon$.
  \item If we can show $\lim s_{2n} = \lim s_{2n+1} = s$ that will imply $\lim s_n = s$ since each $s_n$ is either in $(s_{2n+1})$ or in $(s_{2n})$ as $n$ is must be even or odd.

    We have $s_{2n+1} \le a_1$ since
    $$
    s_{2n+1} = a_1 - (a_2 - a_3) - \dots - (a_{2n} - a_{2n+1}) \le a_1
    $$
    Thus $s_{2n+1} \to s$ by the Monotone Convergence Theorem, to show $(s_{2n}) \to s$ notice $s_{2n} = s_{2n+1} - a_{2n+1}$ with $(a_{2n+1}) \to 0$ meaning we can use the triangle inequality
    $$
    |s_{2n} - s| \le \underbrace{|s_{2n} - s_{2n+1}|}_{a_{2n+1}} + |s_{2n+1} - s| < \epsilon/2 + \epsilon/2 < \epsilon
    $$
    Thus $(s_{2n}) \to s$ aswell finally implying $(s_n) \to s$.

    \textbf{Summary:} Partition the alternating series into two subsequences of partial sums, then use MCT to show they both converge to the same limit.

\begin{exercise}
  Decide whether each of the following series converges or diverges:
  \enum{
  \item $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{2^{n}+n}$
  \item $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{\sin (n)}{n^{2}}$
  \item $1-\frac{3}{4}+\frac{4}{6}-\frac{5}{8}+\frac{6}{10}-\frac{7}{12}+\cdots$
  \item $1+\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{5}-\frac{1}{6}+\frac{1}{7}+\frac{1}{8}-\frac{1}{9}+\cdots$
  \item $1-\frac{1}{2^{2}}+\frac{1}{3}-\frac{1}{4^{2}}+\frac{1}{5}-\frac{1}{6^{2}}+\frac{1}{7}-\frac{1}{8^{2}}+\cdots$
  }
\end{exercise}

\begin{solution}
  \enum{
  \item Converges by a comparison test with $\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{2^n}$.
  \item Converges by a comparison test with $\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^2}$.
  \item Diverges since $(n+1)/2n = 1/2 + 1/2n$ never gets smaller then $1/2$.
  \item The first thing I notice is the series cannot converge absolutely (as then it would be harmonic).

    Grouping terms gives
    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    \frac{1}{n} + \frac{1}{n+1} - \frac{1}{n+2}
    &= \frac{(n+1)(n+2) + n(n+2) - n(n+1)}{n(n+1)(n+2)} \\
    &= \frac{(n^2 + 3n + 2) + (n^2 + 2n) - (n^2 + n)}{n(n+1)(n+2)} \\
    &= \frac{n^2 + 4n + 2}{n(n+1)(n+2)}
    \end{aligned}
    $$
    Which diverges since
    $$
    \frac{n^2 + 4n + 2}{n(n+1)(n+2)} \ge \frac{n^2 + 4n + 2}{n^3} \ge \frac 1n
    $$
    In other words, If we take terms three at a time (a subsequence of the partial sums) grows faster then the harmonic series implying the subsequence (and thus the parent sequence) of partial sums diverges.

    \TODO Find better proof
  \item Intuitively this should diverge since it is a mixture of $1/n$ (divergent) and $1/n^2)$ (convergent). To make this rigorous examine the subsequence $(s_{2n})$
    $$
    s_{2n} = 1 - 1/2^2 + 1/3 - 1/4^2 + \dots + 1/(2n)^2
    $$
    We can the rearrange terms in the partial sum to get
    $$
    s_{2n} = \sum_{k=1}^{n} \frac{1}{2k - 1} - \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{1}{(2k)^2} \equiv t_n - v_n
    $$
    Now if $\lim(s_{2n})$ converges then $\lim(t_n - v_n)$ also converges. This is impossible however as $(t_n)$ diverging and $(v_n)$ converging would imply $\lim(t_n-v_n) + \lim(v_n) = \lim(t_n)$ converges by the ALT, but $(t_n)$ diverges so we have a contradiction. Thus $(s_{2n})$ diverges and so the parent sequence $(s_n)$ must also diverge.

\end{solution}

\begin{exercise}
  \enum{
  \item Provide the details for the proof of the Comparison Test (Theorem 2.7.4) using the Cauchy Criterion for Series.
  \item Give another proof for the Comparison Test, this time using the Monotone Convergence Theorem.
  }
\end{exercise}

\begin{solution}
  Suppose $a_n, b_n \ge 0$, $a_n \le b_n$ and define $s_n = a_1 + \dots + a_n$, $t_n = b_1 + \dots + b_n$.

  \enum{
  \item We have $|a_{m+1} + \dots + a_n| \le |b_{m+1} + \dots + b_n| < \epsilon$ implying $\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n$ converges by the cauchy criterion.
    The other direction is analogous, if $(s_n)$ diverges then $(t_n)$ must also diverge since $s_n \le t_n$.
  \item Since $(t_n) \to t$. This implies that $s_n$ is bounded, and since $s_n \le t_n$ implies $s_n \le t$ by the order limit theorem, we can use the monotone convergence theorem to conclude $(s_n)$ converges.

\begin{exercise}
  Give an example of each or explain why the request is impossible referencing the proper theorem(s).

  \item Let $x_n = (-1)^n/n$ and $y_n = (-1)^n$. $\sum x_n$ converges but $\sum x_ny_n = \sum 1/n$ diverges. 
  \item Impossible as the algebraic limit theorem for series implies $\sum(x_n+y_n) - \sum x_n = \sum y_n$ converges.
  \item Impossible as the alternating series test implies it converges.

\begin{exercise}
  Prove the series $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} 1 / n^{p}$ converges if and only if $p>1$. (Corollary 2.4.7)
\end{exercise}

\begin{solution}
  Eventually we have $1/n^p < 1/p^n$ for $p > 1$ (polynomial vs exponential) meaning we can use the comparison test to conclude $\sum_{n=1}^\infty 1/n^p$ converges if $p > 1$.

  Now suppose $p \le 1$, since $1/n^p \le 1/n$ a comparsion test with the harmonic series implies $p \le 1$ diverges.
\end{solution}

\begin{exercise}
  Let's say that a series subverges if the sequence of partial sums contains a subsequence that converges. Consider this (invented) definition for a moment, and then decide which of the following statements are valid propositions about subvergent series:
  \enum{
  \item If $\left(a_{n}\right)$ is bounded, then $\sum a_{n}$ subverges.
  \item All convergent series are subvergent.
  \item If $\sum\left|a_{n}\right|$ subverges, then $\sum a_{n}$ subverges as well.
  \item If $\sum a_{n}$ subverges, then $\left(a_{n}\right)$ has a convergent subsequence.
  }
\end{exercise}

\begin{solution}
  \enum{
    \item False, consider $a_n = 1$ then $s_n = n$ does not have a convergent subsequence.
    \item True, every subsequence converges to the same limit in fact.
    \item True, since $s_n = \sum_{k=1}^n |a_k|$ converges it is bounded $|s_n| \le M$, and since $t_n = \sum_{k=1}^n a_k$ is smaller $t_n \le s_n$ it is bounded $t_n \le M$ which by BW implies there exists a convergent subsequence $(t_{n_k})$.
    \item False, $a_n = (1, -1, 2, -2, \dots)$ has no convergent subsequence but the sum $s_n = \sum_{k=1}^n a_k$ has the subsequence $(s_{2n}) \to 0$.

  Consider each of the following propositions. Provide short proofs for those that are true and counterexamples for any that are not.
  \enum{
  \item If $\sum a_{n}$ converges absolutely, then $\sum a_{n}^{2}$ also converges absolutely.
  \item If $\sum a_{n}$ converges and $\left(b_{n}\right)$ converges, then $\sum a_{n} b_{n}$ converges.
  \item If $\sum a_{n}$ converges conditionally, then $\sum n^{2} a_{n}$ diverges.
  }
\end{exercise}

\begin{solution}
  \enum{
  \item True since $(a_n) \to 0$ so eventually $a_n^2 \le |a_n|$ meaning $\sum a_n^2$ converges by a comparsion test with $\sum |a_n|$.
  \item False, let $a_n = (-1)^n/{\sqrt n}$ and $b_n = (-1)^n/{\sqrt n}$. $\sum a_n$ converges by the alternating series test, but $\sum a_nb_n = \sum 1/n$ diverges.
  \item True, suppose $(n^2a_n)$ converges, since $(n^2 a_n) \to 0$ we have $|n^2 a_n| < 1$ for $n > N$, implying $|a_n| < 1/n^2$. But if $|a_n| < 1/n^2$ then a comparsion test with $1/n^2$ implies $a_n$ converges absolutely, contradicting the assumption that $a_n$ converges conditionally. Therefor $\sum n^2a_n$ must diverge.

\begin{exercise}[Ratio Test]
  Given a series $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} a_{n}$ with $a_{n} \neq 0$, the Ratio Test states that if $\left(a_{n}\right)$ satisfies
  $$
  \lim \left|\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_{n}}\right|=r<1
  $$
  then the series converges absolutely.

  \enum{
  \item Let $r^{\prime}$ satisfy $r<r^{\prime}<1$. Explain why there exists an $N$ such that $n \geq N$ implies $\left|a_{n+1}\right| \leq\left|a_{n}\right| r^{\prime}$.
  \item Why does $\left|a_{N}\right| \sum\left(r^{\prime}\right)^{n}$ converge?
  \item Now, show that $\sum\left|a_{n}\right|$ converges, and conclude that $\sum a_{n}$ converges.
  }
\end{exercise}

\begin{solution}
  \enum{
  \item We are given
    $$
    \left|\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n} - r\right| < \epsilon
    $$
    Since $1 > r' > r$ we can set $\epsilon = r' - r$ meaning the neighborhood
    $$
    \frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n} \in (r-\epsilon, r+\epsilon) = (2r-r', r')
    $$
    Is all less then $r'$ meaning
    $$
    \left|\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}\right| \le r' \implies |a_{n+1}| \le r'|a_n|
    $$
  \item Let $N$ be large enough that for $n > N$ we have $|a_{n+1}| \le |a_n|r'$.
    Applying this multiple times gives $|a_n| \le (r')^{n-N} |a_N|$ which gives
    $$
    |a_N| + |a_{N+1}| + \dots + |a_n| \le |a_N| + r'|a_N| + \dots + (r')^{n-N}|a_N|
    $$
    Factoring out $|a_N|$ and writing with sums gives
    $$
    \sum_{k=N}^n |a_k| \le |a_N|\sum_{k=0}^{n-1} (r')^k
    $$
    Which converges as $n \to \infty$ since $|r'| < 1$ and $|a_N|$ is constant. Implying $\sum_{k=N}^n |a_k|$ converges and thus $\sum_{k=1}^n |a_k|$ also converges since we only omitted finitely many terms.

\begin{exercise}[Infinite Products]

  \item The infinite product $\frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{3}{4} \cdot \frac{5}{6} \cdot \frac{7}{8} \cdot \frac{9}{10} \cdots$ certainly converges. (Why?) Does it converge to zero?
  \item In 1655, John Wallis famously derived the formula

    Show that the left side of this identity at least converges to something. (A complete proof of this result is taken up in Section 8.3.)
  }
\end{exercise}

\begin{solution}
  \enum{
  \item Rewriting the terms as $a_n = (1 + 1/n)$ and using the result from 2.4.10 implies the product diverges since $\sum 1/n$ diverges.
  \item Converges by the monotone convergence theorem since the partial products are decreasin and greater then zero.
  \item In compontent form we have
    $$
    a_n

    = 1 + \frac{1}{(2n)^2 - 1}
    $$
    And since $\sum 1/((2n)^2 - 1)$ converges by a comparison test with $1/n^2$ 2.4.10 implies
    $$\prod_{n=1}^\infty \left(1 + \frac{1}{(2n)^2 - 1}\right)$$
    also converges.

\begin{exercise}[Abel's Test]
  Abel's Test for convergence states that if the series $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} x_{k}$ converges, and if $\left(y_{k}\right)$ is a sequence satisfying
  $$
  y_{1} \geq y_{2} \geq y_{3} \geq \cdots \geq 0
  $$
  then the series $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} x_{k} y_{k}$ converges.
  \enum{
  \item Use Exercise $2.7 .12$ to show that
    $$
    \sum_{k=1}^{n} x_{k} y_{k}=s_{n} y_{n+1}+\sum_{k=1}^{n} s_{k}\left(y_{k}-y_{k+1}\right)

    where $s_{n}=x_{1}+x_{2}+\cdots+x_{n}$.
  \item Use the Comparison Test to argue that $\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} s_{k}\left(y_{k}-y_{k+1}\right)$ converges absolutely, and show how this leads directly to a proof of Abel's Test.
  }
\end{exercise}

\begin{solution}
  Intuitively, Abel's test is saying that multiplying by a positive decreasing sequence $(y_n)$ is basically the same as multiplying by a constant in that it doesn't effect convergence.

  \enum{
  \item Exercise 2.7.12 combined with $s_0=0$ gives
    $$
    \sum_{k=1}^n x_ky_k = s_ny_{n+1} + \sum_{k=1}^n s_k(y_k - y_{k+1})
    $$
    as desired.
  \item $s_ny_{n+1}$ clearly converges since $y_{n+1}$ is ``eventually constant'', so we must only show the right hand side converges.

    We will show absolute convergence, note $y_k - y_{k+1} \ge 0$ and so
    $$
    \sum_{k=1}^n |s_k|(y_k - y_{k+1}) \ge 0
    $$
    Bounding $|s_n| \le M$ gives
    $$
    \sum_{k=1}^n |s_k|(y_k - y_{k+1}) \le M \sum_{k=1}^n (y_k-y_{k+1})
    $$
    Since $\sum_{k=1}^n (y_k - y_{k+1}) = y_1 - y_{n+1}$ is telescoping we can write
    $$
    \sum_{k=1}^n |s_k|(y_k - y_{k+1}) \le M(y_1 - y_{n+1}) \le My_1
    $$
    Implying $\sum_{k=1}^\infty |s_k|(y_k - y_{k+1})$ converges since it is bounded and increasing.
    And since the series converges absolutely so does the original $\sum_{k=1}^\infty s_k(y_k - y_{k+1})$.

    \textbf{Summary:} Bound $|s_k| \le M$ and use the fact that $\sum(y_k - y_{k+1})$ is telescoping.
