\section{Continuous Functions}

\begin{exercise}
  Let $g(x)=\sqrt[3]{x}$.
  \enum{
  \item Prove that $g$ is continuous at $c=0$.
  \item Prove that $g$ is continuous at a point $c \ne 0$. (The identity $a^{3}-b^{3}=$ $(a-b)\left(a^{2}+a b+b^{2}\right)$ will be helpful.)
  }
\end{exercise}

\begin{solution}
  \enum{
  \item Let $\epsilon > 0$ be arbitrary and set $\delta = \epsilon^3$. If $|x-0| < \delta = \epsilon^3$ then taking the cube root of both sides gives $|x|^{1/3} < 1/\epsilon$ and since $(-x)^{1/3} = -(x^{1/3})$ we have $|x|^{1/3} = |x^{1/3}| < \epsilon$.
  \item We must make $|x^{1/3} - c^{1/3}| < \epsilon$ by making $|x - c|$ small. The identity given allows us to write
    $$
    |x^{1/3} - c^{1/3}| = |x - c| \cdot |x^{2/3} + x^{1/3}c^{1/3} + c^{2/3}|
    $$
    We can bound $|x^{2/3} + x^{1/3}c^{1/3} + c^{2/3}| \le |x^{2/3}| + |x^{1/3}c^{1/3}| + |c^{2/3}| \le |c^{2/3}|$ to get
    $$
    |x^{1/3} - c^{1/3}| \le |x - c| \cdot |c^{2/3}|
    $$
    Setting $\delta = \frac{\epsilon}{|c^{2/3}|}$ gives $|x^{1/3} - c^{1/3}| \le \epsilon$ completing the proof.
  }
\end{solution}


\begin{exercise}
  To gain a deeper understanding of the relationship between $\epsilon$ and $\delta$ in the definition of continuity, let's explore some modest variations of Definition 4.3.1. In all of these, let $f$ be a function defined on all of $\mathbf{R}$.
  \enum {
  \item Let's say $f$ is \emph{onetinuous} at $c$ if for all $\epsilon>0$ we can choose $\delta=1$ and it follows that $|f(x)-f(c)|<\epsilon$ whenever $|x-c|<\delta$. Find an example of a function that is onetinuous on all of $\mathbf{R}$.
  \item Let's say $f$ is \emph{equaltinuous} at $c$ if for all $\epsilon>0$ we can choose $\delta=\epsilon$ and it follows that $|f(x)-f(c)|<\epsilon$ whenever $|x-c|<\delta .$ Find an example of a function that is equaltinuous on $\mathbf{R}$ that is nowhere onetinuous, or explain why there is no such function.
  \item Let's say $f$ is \emph{lesstinuous} at $c$ if for all $\epsilon>0$ we can choose $0<\delta<\epsilon$ and it follows that $|f(x)-f(c)|<\epsilon$ whenever $|x-c|<\delta$. Find an example of a function that is lesstinuous on $\mathbf{R}$ that is nowhere equaltinuous, or explain why there is no such function.
  \item Is every lesstinuous function continuous? Is every continuous function lesstinuous? Explain.
  }
\end{exercise}

\begin{solution}
  \enum {
  \item The constant function $f(x) = k$ is onetinuous, in fact it is the only onetinuous function (Think about why)
  \item The line $f(x) = x$ is equaltinuous
  \item $f(x) = 2x$ is lesstinuous but nowhere-equaltinuous
  \item Every lesstinuous function is continuous, since the definition of lesstinuous is just continuous plus the requirement that $0 < \delta < \epsilon$.

    And every continuous function is lesstinuous since if $\delta > 0$ works we can set $\delta' < \delta$ and $\delta' < \epsilon$ so that $|x-c| < \delta' < \delta$ still implies $|f(x)-f(c)| < \epsilon$
  }
\end{solution}


\begin{exercise}
  \enum{
  \item Supply a proof for Theorem 4.3.9 (Composition of continuous functions) using the $\epsilon-\delta$ characterization of continuity.
  \item Give another proof of this theorem using the sequential characterization of continuity (from Theorem 4.3.2 (iii)).
  }
\end{exercise}

\begin{solution}
  \enum{
  \item Let $f$ is continuous at $c$ and $g$ be continuous at $f(c)$. We will show $g \circ f$ is continuous at $c$.
    Let $\epsilon > 0$ be arbitrary, we want $|g(f(x)) - g(f(c))| < \epsilon$ for $|x-c| < \delta$.
    Pick $\alpha > 0$ so that $|y - f(c)| < \alpha$ implies $|g(y) - g(f(c))| < \epsilon$ (possible since $g$ is continuous at $f(c)$) and pick $\delta > 0$ so that $|x-c|<\delta$ implies $|f(x)-f(c)|<\alpha$. Putting all of this together we have
    $$|x-c| < \delta \implies |f(x) - f(c)| < \alpha \implies |g(f(x)) - g(f(c))| < \epsilon$$
  \item Let $(x_n) \to c$, we know $f(x_n)$ is a sequence converging to $f(c)$ since $f$ is continuous at $c$, and since $g$ is continuous at $f(c)$ any sequence $(y_n) \to f(c)$ has $g(y_n) \to g(f(c))$. Letting $y_n = f(x_n)$ gives $g(f(x_n)) \to g(f(c))$ as desired.
  }
\end{solution}


\begin{exercise}
  Assume $f$ and $g$ are defined on all of $\mathbf{R}$ and that $\lim_{x \rightarrow p} f(x)=q$ and $\lim _{x \rightarrow q} g(x)=r$.
  \enum {
  \item Give an example to show that it may not be true that
    $$
    \lim _{x \rightarrow p} g(f(x))=r
    $$
  \item Show that the result in (a) does follow if we assume $f$ and $g$ are continuous.
  \item Does the result in (a) hold if we only assume $f$ is continuous? How about if we only assume that $g$ is continuous?
  }
\end{exercise}

\begin{solution}
  \enum{
  \item Let $f(x) = q$ be constant and define $g(x)$ as
    $$g(x) = \begin{cases}(r/q)x &\text{ if } x \ne q \\ 0 &\text{ if } x = q \end{cases}$$
    We have $\lim_{x \to q} g(x) = r$ but $\lim_{x \to p} g(f(x)) = g(q) = 0$.

    The problem is that functional limits allow jump discontinuities by requiring $y \ne q$ in $\lim_{y \to q} g(y)$ but $f(x)$ might not respect $f(x) \ne q$ as $x \to p$.
    Continuity fixes this by requiring $\lim_{y \to q} g(y) = g(q)$ so that $f(x) = q$ doesn't break anything.

    Another fix would be requiring $f(x) \ne q$ for all $x \ne p$ - In other words that the error is always greater then zero $0 < |f(x) - q| < \epsilon$ similar to $0<|x-p|<\delta$. This would allow chaining of functional limits, however it would make it impossible to take limits of ``locally flat'' functions.
  \item Theorem 4.3.9 (Proved in Exercise 4.3.3)
  \item Not if $f$ is continuous (in our example $f$ was continuous). Yes if $g$ is continuous since it would get rid of the $f(x) = q$ problem.
  }
\end{solution}

\begin{exercise}
  Show using Definition 4.3.1 that if $c$ is an isolated point of $A \subseteq \mathbf{R}$, then $f: A \rightarrow \mathbf{R}$ is continuous at $c$
\end{exercise}

\begin{solution}
  Since $c$ is isolated, we can set $\delta$ small enough that the only $x \in A$ satisfying $|x - c| < \delta$ is $x = c$. Then clearly $|f(x) - f(c)| < \epsilon$ since $f(x) = f(c)$ for all $|x-c|<\delta$.
\end{solution}
