\begin{exercise}[Lipschitz Functions]
  A function $f: A \rightarrow \mathrm{R}$ is called Lipschitz if there exists a bound $M>0$ such that
  $$
  \left|\frac{f(x)-f(y)}{x-y}\right| \leq M
  $$
  for all $x \neq y \in A$. Geometrically speaking, a function $f$ is Lipschitz if there is a uniform bound on the magnitude of the slopes of lines drawn through any two points on the graph of $f$.
  \enum{
  \item Show that if $f: A \rightarrow \mathbf{R}$ is Lipschitz, then it is uniformly continuous on $A$.
  \item Is the converse statement true? Are all uniformly continuous functions necessarily Lipschitz?

  f(x)+g(x), \quad f(x) g(x), \quad \frac{f(x)}{g(x)}, \quad f(g(x)) ?

\begin{exercise}[Continuous Extension Theorem]
  \enum{
  \item Show that a uniformly continuous function preserves Cauchy sequences; that is, if $f: A \rightarrow \mathbf{R}$ is uniformly continuous and $\left(x_{n}\right) \subseteq A$ is a Cauchy sequence, then show $f\left(x_{n}\right)$ is a Cauchy sequence.
  \item Let $g$ be a continuous function on the open interval $(a, b)$. Prove that $g$ is uniformly continuous on $(a, b)$ if and only if it is possible to define values $g(a)$ and $g(b)$ at the endpoints so that the extended function $g$ is continuous on $[a, b]$. (In the forward direction, first produce candidates for $g(a)$ and $g(b)$, and then show the extended $g$ is continuous.)
