\section{The Intermediate Value Theorem}

\begin{exercise}
  Show how the Intermediate Value Theorem follows as a corollary to preservation of connected sets (Theorem 4.5.2).
\end{exercise}
\begin{solution}
  Let $f$ be a continuous function defined over $[a,b]$. And let $L$ be a real number such that $f(a) < L < f(b)$.

  Define $A = \{x \in [a,b] : f(x) \le L\}$ and $B = \{x \in [a,b] : f(x) > L\}$. $A,B$ are clearly disjoint, they are also nonempty since $a \in A$ and $b \in B$. Since $[a,b]$ is connected there exists a sequence in $A$ or $B$ with limit in the other. Let $(x_n)$ be such a sequence, I claim $(x_n) \to x$ with $f(x) = L$.

  $(x_n)$ cannot be contained in $A$ since $f(x_n) \le L$ implies $f(x) \le L$ and $x \in A$ ($A$ is closed)

  If $(x_n)$ is contained in $B$ then $f(x_n) > L$ implies $f(x) \ge L$ by the Order Limit Theorem. But since $x \in A$ we have $f(x) \le A$ as well. Thus $f(x) = L$ completing the proof.
\end{solution}

\begin{exercise}
  Provide an example of each of the following, or explain why the request is impossible
  \enum{
  \item A continuous function defined on an open interval with range equal to a closed interval.
  \item A continuous function defined on a closed interval with range equal to an open interval.
  \item A continuous function defined on an open interval with range equal to an unbounded closed set different from $\mathbf{R}$.
  \item A continuous function defined on all of $\mathbf{R}$ with range equal to $\mathbf{Q}$.
  }
\end{exercise}
\begin{solution}
  \enum{
  \item Possible, see Exercise 4.4.8 (b)
  \item Impossible by preservation of compact sets
  \item Let $f : (0,1) \to [2, \infty)$ be defined by
    $$
    f(x) = \begin{cases}
      \frac 1x &\text{ if } x \in (0, 1/2] \\
      \frac{1}{1-x} &\text{ if } x \in (1/2, 1)
    \end{cases}
    $$
    This works since $[2,\infty)$ is closed, unbounded and different from $\mathbf{R}$.
  \item Impossible as this contradicts the intermediate value theorem.
  }
\end{solution}

\begin{exercise}
  A function $f$ is increasing on $A$ if $f(x) \leq f(y)$ for all $x<y$ in $A$. Show that if $f$ is increasing on $[a, b]$ and satisfies the intermediate value property (Definition 4.5.3), then $f$ is continuous on $[a, b]$.
\end{exercise}
\begin{solution}
  Let $x \in [a,b]$ and choose $\epsilon > 0$.
  Let $L \in (f(a), f(x)) \cap (f(x)-\epsilon, f(x))$ IVP lets us find $c \in (a, x)$ with $f(c)= L$, thus $|f(x) - f(c)| < \epsilon$.
  Likewise we can find $d \in (x,b)$ with $|f(d)-f(x)|<\epsilon$.
  Because $f$ is increasing $f(x)-f(c) < \epsilon$ implies $f(x)-f(c')<\epsilon$ for $c' \in (c, x)$ (and likewise for $d$) meaning every $y \in (c, d)$ has $|f(x)-f(y)|<\epsilon$. To get a $\delta$-neighborhood simply set $\delta = \min\{x-c, d-x\}$.
\end{solution}

\begin{exercise}
  Let $g$ be continuous on an interval $A$ and let $F$ be the set of points where $g$ fails to be one-to-one; that is,
  $$
  F=\{x \in A: f(x)=f(y) \text { for some } y \neq x \text { and } y \in A\} \text {. }
  $$
  Show $F$ is either empty or uncountable.
\end{exercise}
\begin{solution}
  % TODO: Cleanup
  Suppose $F$ is nonempty, let $x,y \in A$ with $x \ne y$ and $f(x) = f(y)$. Pick $z \in (x,y)$ such that $f(z) \ne f(x)$ (if $z$ does not exist $f$ is constant over $(x,y)$ and we are finished early). By the Intermediate Value Theorem every $L \in (f(x), f(z))$ has an $x' \in (x, z)$ with $f(x') = L$. And since $L \in (f(z), f(y))$ as well we can find $y' \in (z,y)$ with $f(y') = L$, thus $f(y') = f(x')$ and so $f$ is not 1-1 at every $L \in (f(x), f(z))$ which is uncountable.

  Let $f:[0,1] \rightarrow \mathbf{R}$ be continuous with $f(0)=f(1)$
  \enum{
  \item Show that there must exist $x, y \in[0,1]$ satisfying $|x-y|=1 / 2$ and $f(x)=f(y) .$

  \item If $h \in(0,1 / 2)$ is not of the form $1 / n$, there does not necessarily exist $|x-y|=h$ satisfying $f(x)=f(y)$. Provide an example that illustrates this using $h=2 / 5$.

  Let $f$ be a continuous function on the closed interval $[0,1]$ with range also contained in $[0,1]$. Prove that $f$ must have a fixed point; that is, show $f(x)=x$ for at least one value of $x \in[0,1]$.

\begin{exercise}[Inverse functions]
  If a function $f: A \rightarrow \mathbf{R}$ is one-to-one, then we can define the inverse function $f^{-1}$ on the range of $f$ in the natural way: $f^{-1}(y)=x$ where $y=f(x)$.

  Show that if $f$ is continuous on an interval $[a, b]$ and one-to-one, then $f^{-1}$ is also continuous.
